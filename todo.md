# CSV to Video with FFmpeg Rendering Implementation Plan

## Requirements Analysis
- Need to modify the existing CSV to video system to create a complete product narration like in example.html
- Replace media recording with FFmpeg rendering for video generation
- Maintain all existing functionality while adding new features

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Analyze Current Implementation
- [x] Review example.html to understand the product narration system
- [x] Examine app.py to understand current CSV to video implementation
- [x] Review templates/index.html for UI components
- [x] Analyze static/js/app.js for frontend functionality
- [x] Study example.csv for data structure

### 2. Set up Necessary Files
- [ ] Create new Python functions for FFmpeg-based video rendering
- [ ] Modify app.py to integrate FFmpeg rendering
- [ ] Update frontend UI to match example.html style
- [ ] Create new JavaScript functions for product narration

### 3. Implement Main Functionality
- [ ] Develop FFmpeg rendering pipeline for product videos
- [ ] Implement product narration generation using Gemini TTS
- [ ] Create scene-based video composition
- [ ] Add subtitle and watermark support
- [ ] Implement video transition effects

### 4. Handle Edge Cases
- [ ] Error handling for FFmpeg processes
- [ ] Timeout handling for long video rendering
- [ ] Memory management for large video files
- [ ] Validation for CSV data formats
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms for failed renders

### 5. Test Implementation
- [ ] Test with sample CSV data
- [ ] Verify FFmpeg rendering quality
- [ ] Check product narration accuracy
- [ ] Validate subtitle and watermark features
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios

### 6. Verify Results
- [ ] Compare output with example.html functionality
- [ ] Ensure all product details are correctly narrated
- [ ] Verify video quality and format
- [ ] Confirm all UI elements work correctly
- [ ] Document implementation details
